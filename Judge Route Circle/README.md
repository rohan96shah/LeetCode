### Question
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to __the original place__.<br/><br/>

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), L (Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.<br/><br/>

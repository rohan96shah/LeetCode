### Question

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.<br/>

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.<br/>

__For example:__
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,<br/>
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
 ```
 return its depth = 3.

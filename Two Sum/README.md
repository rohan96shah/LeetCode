### Question
Given an array of integers, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br/>
You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the __same__ element twice.<br/>
*Example:*
`Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,<br/><br/>
 Because nums[*0*] + nums[*1*] = 2 + 7 = 9,<br/>
 return [*0, 1*].`

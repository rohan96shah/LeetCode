### Question

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.<br/><br/>

For example,<br/>
`"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` is a palindrome.<br/>
`"race a car"` is *not* a palindrome.<br/><br/>

__Note:__
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.<br/>

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
